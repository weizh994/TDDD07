# Lesson: Scheduling and Resource sharing
## Cyclic scheduling
* determine minor/major cycle
* construct a schedule
* identify output jitter
* adapt to requirements
## EDF
* perform and interput the schedulability test
## RMS
* perform and interput the schedulability test
* perform response time analysis
* use ICP
* calculate blocking times
* determine process priority
