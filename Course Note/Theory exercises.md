# 1. Scheduling and Resource Sharing
   
## Q1.1:  
Construct a cyclic schedule for the following process set and present the minor and major cycles respectively. Argue the result and analyse the case assuming that **no output jitter is tolerated**.
|*Task*|*Period(ms)*|*WCET(ms)*|
|:----|:----|:----|
|A|50|5|
|B|30|10|
|C|20|5|
* minor cycles is 10ms
* major cycles is 300ms

The schedulable gets guaranteed since $U<G$

## Q1.2:
